"""Chiplotter""" is a GUI designed for easy plotting of Fit2d generated chi files.
The GUI provides also an easy way to create Fit2d macros for integration.
Edit the "pipeline.py" and "mycakeparameters1.txt" to select the correct
integration parameters, and add more parameter files if you wish to integrate
different sections.
